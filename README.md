# C-HTTP-Communication
Using Libcurl and Boost, I implement the basic REST API functions in C++. This is a more casual project that I did in preperation for one of my interviews for their "Integration Round". I used Visual Studio and after a lot of pain to figure out how to get Boost and Libcurl to work properly, I made the program and figured out the CMake.
